### Abstract

Some elemental problems faced by the parking lots in large cities include the difficulty in locating a free parking spot, security of the parked vehicle as well as people parking in a reserved parking spot. In this paper we propose a blended use of the mobile application, computer vision and IoT technologies to counter these problems and if it is implemented, it will surely save some valuable time. We will also be able to guarantee the security of the parked vehicle using automatic security bollards. We will be using Node MCU as a microcontroller and ultrasonic sensors as proximity sensors. We will also be using CCTV camera live footage for verifying readings from the IoT devices to eliminate all the false positives. At all times the system will display the live status of the parking spaces in the parking lots to all the users of the mobile application.
